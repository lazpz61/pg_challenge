  {Coding Challenge Submission Quesitons}

  Decision I made in my app :

  I was unsuccessful with the time given to work on this applicaiton, because I was dealing with personal matters and didnt have the time to allocate properly on this challenge.

  How to run my app:

  I utilized React-Router-Redux for this application.

  What I learned:

  I learned that I need more practice with creating functionalities in an e-commerce website like search capabilities, sorting, and filtering based on certain criteria. This was my first ever e-commerce epplication, and I am humbled to have been given the opportunitiy to attempt this coding challenge.

  Challenges I faced:

  Not understanding if I needed to use a functional component or class component to render the search bar into the main app.js file. Also I had a challenge with understanding how the props would work to bring in the search terms to make the change render on the main display page.

  What I would od if given more time:

  I would restart the application from scratch and implement an e-commerce site from a tutorial with the similar functionalities asked of from the coding challenge. The reason I did not do this initially was because I beleived I had the understanding to implement what I would have like to be implemented, but when actually divining into the code I ran into a lot of bugs, which I was not able to rmeedy in an adequete amount of time.

  How I think the test could be imporved:

  I think this challenge was quite perfect to be honest, and I know that with more practice on creating e-commerce website I will do better than I did this time around. I am new to programming and front end development and for me to have even rendered the product on the screen amazes me right now. I have taken at least 2 months to understand data structures and algorithms, and have been away from actual react developement, so this challenge was truly a wake up call to me. Thank you for giving me this opportunity.
